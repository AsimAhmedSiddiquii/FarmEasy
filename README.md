# FarmEasy: Farmers Hub

## Hosted site

Customer: https://farmeasy-kjsce.herokuapp.com/
<br/>
Farmer: https://farmeasy-kjsce.herokuapp.com/farmer

## Problem Definition:
- With this website, consumers can find nearby farmers using geolocation, purchase produce online, and pick up orders via
  curbside pickup to avoid direct contact. Farmers can easily manage items and fulfill orders as well. 
  This gives farmers a leg up in the online food industry.
  
- During COVID-19, many farmers have excess produce with no way to sell it, while consumers find it difficult to purchase directly from farms as few farms have an online
  presence. Further, local markets now have strict rules and capacity limits (as social distancing has to be followed due to COVID-19), so farmers who typically sold products at these markets saw a decrease in sales.

## Objectives:
- The objective of this project is to connect the farmers and the customers so that they can sell their produce directly and execute the agro-business effectively. This application
  would be very supportive for most of the farmers since they are less aware of the current trends and technology. Due to this ignorance and lack of appropriate information, the
  middlemen take advantage over the farmer community and this brings down their profit.
